# basin_extract
Python package for extracting river basins from Digital Election Models (DEMs)

The *basin_extract* package was developed as part of the EU funded project [NUNATARYUK](https://nunataryuk.org). 
NUNATARYUK aims at determining the impacts of thawing coastal and subsea permafrost on the global climate, 
and will develop targeted and co-designed adaptation and mitigation strategies for the Arctic coastal population.
